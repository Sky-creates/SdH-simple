# SdH-simple
Simple version of SdH analysis program that does the fitting after manual data extraction. GUI provided. MATLAB based.

Three input filesï¼›
1. oscillation peak amplitudes scanned with magnetic field at a fixed temperature T0
2. oscillation peak amplitudes scanned with temperature at a fixed magnetic field B0

one input data:
1. temperature T0
2. Magnetic field B0
3. resistivity at T=T0, B=0

structure input files as indicated in the GUI.

The more data provided, the more information can be extracted.
For example application, see  Physical Review B 102 035125.
